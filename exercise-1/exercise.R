# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")
hawksscore <- c(12,3,37,27)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
hawksgaveup <- c(10,9,18,17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
my.dataframe <- data.frame(hawksscore,hawksgaveup)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
my.dataframe

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom


# Create a vector of the opponents


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
